Licences and API Access
-----------------------

Departments and colleges across the University of Oxford can now obtain access via IT services to two major generative AI tools: [ChatGPT Edu](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-edu/) and [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/copilot?msockid=05f1f8d62950675a1279eb74289b6645). These tools empower staff to use the capabilities of generative AI for research, teaching, and administration, all while ensuring data security and seamless collaboration within the University. [See our purchasing page for more details or to purchase licences.](https://staff.admin.ox.ac.uk/buying-generative-ai-licences)

**OpenAI API Access**:

To request access follow these steps:

* If you would like access to the OpenAI API, please fill out the request form [Requesting OpenAI API Access](https://unioxfordnexus.sharepoint.com/:l:/s/ITServices-Competencycentres/FJZ9BOTALbtOsdsx8mL-WekBLoufku2zBasdJBncaf5_qw?nav=ZjVkMTNhZTYtNTNkMS00ZWM4LWEwMDEtMDg3OTRkMDMyYmU1) and explain for which project you intend to use the API.
* We will be in touch with next steps or follow-up questions. **Due to capacity, it may take up to five working days** for us to review and respond to your request.
* Note that we initially set a **$50 limit per month and project**. If your project requires more extensive API access, please mention it on the form so that we can discuss your project needs. If you notice you need a higher limit for an existing project, please contact us.

**Coding Assistants**: Accelerate your coding with tools like GitHub Copilot, which is free for academic staff and University students. These tools can help streamline coding tasks and improve productivity. Learn more about coding assistants and how to access GitHub Copilot on [our FAQ page](https://staff.admin.ox.ac.uk/ai-and-ml-competency-centre-faqs-and-guides).

If you’re interested in other AI tools or APIs, we can provide advice and support with obtaining licences.

Project Support We Offer
------------------------

AI has the potential to transform research across a wide range of disciplines. We are here to support researchers at every stage, whether you're exploring initial ideas or implementing advanced solutions. Below are just a few ways AI can make an impact in research:

##### Data Analysis and Pattern Recognition

AI excels at processing large volumes of structured or unstructured data, uncovering patterns and insights that might otherwise go unnoticed. This is particularly valuable in data-intensive fields like **genomics**, **social sciences**, and **climate research**.

##### Predictive Modelling and Forecasting

Machine learning (ML) models can predict outcomes or trends based on historical data, making it a powerful tool in fields such as **economics**, **epidemiology**, and **environmental science**. These models can inform decision-making, guide experimental design, and forecast future trends.

##### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP tools can analyse and interpret textual data, supporting disciplines like **history**, **law**, and **literature**. Tasks such as document summarization, translation, sentiment analysis, and information extraction from complex texts can be streamlined with AI.

##### Image and Video Analysis

AI-powered tools can analyse visual data, from medical imaging and satellite photography to historical artifacts and environmental monitoring. This is especially useful in fields like **medicine**, **archaeology**, and **ecology**.

### How We Can Help You Along the Way

We understand that starting with AI in research can be daunting. Here are some ways we can support you:

* **Exploring AI for Your Work**: If you're curious about how LLMs or AI might support your research but aren't sure where to begin, check out our workshops or reach out to discuss a custom session tailored to your needs.
* **Starting from an Idea**: Have a few ideas for using AI in your research but don't know where to start? Get in touch! We can discuss your goals and point you toward helpful resources.
* **Understanding ML in Your Field**: Found an exciting paper in your field that uses ML, but struggling with the technical details? We'd be happy to help explain the techniques or recommend learning resources to bridge the gap.
* **Building on Existing Work**: Have a research idea inspired by an ML-based paper but unsure how to implement it? Our Research Software Engineers can support your team with ML implementations and recommend or provide training as needed.
* **Uncertain About AI's Role in Your Research?** Not sure if your question fits into these categories? Let’s have a quick chat to explore your ideas and find the best way forward.
