[Student News](https://www.ox.ac.uk/students/news-list/archive) is a roundup of strategic content and significant updates relevant to all, or a large majority of, students at the University.

The newsletter is sent to all students, broken down into two versions: the Undergraduate Student News newsletter and the Graduate Student News newsletter.
