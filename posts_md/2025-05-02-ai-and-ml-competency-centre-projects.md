The AI and ML Competency Centre is supporting projects across the University to enable deployment of commercial AI tools in a controlled and secure environment. See below for more information on what these are and how you can get involved in future projects.

### ChatGPT Enterprise Pilot

We are currently running a pilot project to investigate the suitability of ChatGPT Enterprise. Pilot participants have been taking part in personalised introductory training to get to know the tool. We are also sending out regular communications about new features and use cases in a dedicated community on Teams. [Learn more about the ChatGPT Enterprise pilot](https://staff.admin.ox.ac.uk/generative-ai-enterprise-licence-pilot).

### Microsoft 365 Copilot Pilot

We are currently running a pilot of Microsoft 365 Copilot with 500 participants from across the University. This is intended to discover the suitability of integrated tools within the Microsoft ecosystem.

At the Oxford Digital Festival 2024, pilot participants spoke about how they've been using generative AI tools including Copilot and ChatGPT in their work. You can hear what they said in the [recording of the "AI and me" session](https://ox.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=b2e01a8d-2e35-4e49-bbba-b23000e92d4c) at the festival (SSO required).

### AI Teaching and Learning Exploration Fund

In partnership with the Centre for Teaching and Learning, the AI and ML Competency Centre have launched the AI Teaching and Learning Exploratory Fund. The fund aims to support the exploration of AI in teaching learning and academic administration at Oxford.

Applications for this fund have now closed. [Learn more about the AI Teaching and Learning Exploratory Fund](https://ctl.ox.ac.uk/ai-teaching-and-learning-exploratory-fund).

[View the list of projects supported through the AI Teaching and Learning Exploratory Fund in 2024-25](https://ctl.ox.ac.uk/2024-25-funded-projects).

Projects will be sharing their insights, experiences, and key findings from the last year at a special event on Wednesday 9 July. [Learn more about the AI Knowledge Exchange Forum](https://ctl.ox.ac.uk/event/ai-knowledge-exchange-forum) - the event is now at full capacity and bookings are now closed.

### Generative AI tools for research

We are supporting the Bodleian iSkills programme in developing a training programme and review generative AI tools suitable for supporting literature research. The main focus of this project are tools such as Elicit, Consensus, and Connected Papers.
