Currently supported tools
-------------------------

The University is currently actively supporting these two tools. They are available for purchase through IT Services: [Buying Generative AI licence](https://staff.admin.ox.ac.uk/buying-generative-ai-licences)s.

#### ChatGPT Edu

ChatGPT is the best known generative AI application. Its launch in November 2022 sparked the current generative AI revolution and it is arguably the best place to start learning about what generative AI can do. It has some of the most advanced models and most comprehensive features and there are five tiers available to users: free, Plus, Team, Edu and Enterprise – each of these slightly differs regarding the features available, the amount you can use them, and the confidentiality of the data you input.

We are currently running a Pilot with 250 people of ChatGPT Edu and we are exploring ways of expanding access to more people. If you are interested in purchasing a ChatGPT Edu licence, you can [find out more information on our webpage.](https://staff.admin.ox.ac.uk/buying-generative-ai-licences)

#### Microsoft 365 Copilot

Microsoft 365 Copilot is distinct from [Copilot Chat](#Microsoft%20Copilot%20Chat). It is an integration of generative AI models into Exchange, Teams and Microsoft Office. It offers features such as summarising email conversations, creating PowerPoint presentations out of documents, creating meeting minutes, etc. If you are wanting to use Copilot to record or transcribe meetings, you must first request access to do so: [Record a meeting in Teams | IT Help](https://help.it.ox.ac.uk/record-a-meeting-in-teams)

We are currently supporting a pilot programme with 500 users across the University. Microsoft 365 Copilot is also available for departments at the estimated cost of £26/per person/per month. You can find out more about [purchasing Copilot for Microsoft 365 licences on our webpage](https://staff.admin.ox.ac.uk/buying-generative-ai-licences).

#### Microsoft Copilot Chat

Microsoft Copilot (Chat) is a limited alternative to ChatGPT offered for free by Microsoft. When users login to Copilot with their Oxford University SSO, they will be offered additional enterprise protections.

Note: Free Copilot Chat does not offer integration with Microsoft Office.

Note on data

*Both ChatGPT and Copilot, when purchased through the Centre, are suitable for all confidential and personally identifiable information. We have an agreement with both OpenAI and Microsoft to not use the University data for training, finetuning or evaluating their models.*

Tools we are exploring
----------------------

We are currently exploring a number of generative AI tools for research, teaching and administration.

#### Claude.ai

Claude.ai is the best known alternative to ChatGPT by a company called Anthropic. It is a chatbot with advanced models that are known to be particularly well suited to summarising longer documents, writing and creating computer code.

We are currently trialling Claude internally and supporting the Bodleian iSkills programme in designing training for it.

#### Elicit

Elicit is a specialised type of generative AI application focused on supporting literature reviews. It searches real academic databases based on user questions or allows users to upload their own documents. Instead of a simple chat with individual documents, Elicit can extract information from collections of documents based on prompts.
