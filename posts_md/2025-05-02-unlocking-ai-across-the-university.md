The [AI and Machine Learning Competency Centre](https://staff.admin.ox.ac.uk/digital/services/competency-centres/ai-and-ml) has been conducting [customised workshops](https://staff.admin.ox.ac.uk/ai-and-ml-competency-centre-training#/Custom%20workshops) in colleges and departments to help staff and students access and apply AI tools in their work and studies. As AI becomes more prevalent, it is necessary to ensure that all members of the University can explore the use of these tools safely and ethically in accordance with guidelines.

Lead Business Technologist Kelly Webb-Davies has been leading some of these workshops. One such example from Michaelmas term ’24 was the half-day Student AI Skills Induction workshop. Module leads from the Medical Sciences Division (MSD) organised this workshop for incoming master’s students to provide a general introduction to generative AI and its capabilities. The aim was to equip these students with a better understanding of AI as they enter their degrees and learn how to approach these tools effectively and responsibly.

In her session, Kelly explained how to use generative AI responsibly, reminding students to use these tools cautiously and demonstrating their limitations as search engines or referencing tools. She used the analogy of identifying AI as ‘the stranger you spoke to at the pub’ to emphasise the need to fact-check answers given by AI and take everything it provides with a pinch of salt.

The lecture wasn’t all doom and gloom though. Kelly also described AI as ‘The Intern’, ‘The Translator’, and ‘The Tutor’ to show how tools like ChatGPT can be used to check grammar, provide suggestions and perspectives, alter writing style, and even help to create quizzes or explain complex concepts. Kelly’s session was well received by students who said:

> The information was very well targeted to the audience. It taught me instances that I can use AI and others that I should stay away from engaging with this tech.

> I liked the clarity about how we can actually use AI for academic writing. It is helpful to have it acknowledged as a tool rather than not discussed, since it is such a prevalent system.

This is just one example of the sessions run by the AI and ML Competency Centre. The team can also offer sessions introducing different AI tools and how best to apply these for more productive study, addressing strengths and limitations of each. Providing students with the platform to ask questions about AI and learn about how to apply tools responsibly in their studies is critical to unlocking the future of digital education.
