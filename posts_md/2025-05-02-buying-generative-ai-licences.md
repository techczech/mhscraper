If you are currently paying for ChatGPT Plus or Teams individually, we strongly recommend you consider switching to ChatGPT Edu. Transitioning to the Edu licence will provide better value, stronger privacy protections, and access to features designed specifically for academic environments. The University-managed licence also ensures compliance with institutional data policies.

By using ChatGPT Edu instead of free or individually purchased versions, University of Oxford **staff can confidently use ChatGPT for their academic and administrative work** while maintaining appropriate data protection standards.

### Reasons to switch to ChatGPT Edu:

* **Saving money.** We are offering a ChatGPT Edu licence at a reduced rate. It is cheaper than a Plus or Teams licence.
* **Better security.** You can **access ChatGPT Edu via your SSO,** which gives you more security and convenience than either the Plus or Teams licence.
* **Share your GPTs and chats** privately with others in the Oxford workspace or with the whole Oxford workspace all at once.
* **Enhanced data protection:** Unlike the free and Plus versions (where you have to manually opt out of allowing your data to be used to train OpenAI’s data models), data you input into ChatGPT Edu is not shared to train OpenAI's models by default. This means you maintain full ownership of all your inputs and outputs, which is important when working with research data or sensitive university information.
* **Security assessment.** Only ChatGPT Edu is covered by InfoSec’s third-party security assessment (TPSA). This is the same security assessment that covers all use of Microsoft 365 across the University. If you feel secure uploading files to Sharepoint, you should feel at ease uploading your files to ChatGPT Edu.

### Things to bear in mind:

* There is **no export option** of your data if you are using in ChatGPT Edu (this is also the case for the Teams licence, but Plus or Free accounts however do allow data export).
* Occasionally, **some new features and models are released on a delay** to ChatGPT Edu to allow for review or compliance. This is usually about a week or so later but occasionally longer.

### Migrating your existing data:

You can only automatically merge your chat history from a Free or Plus account if you used your SSO ([abcd1234@ox.ac.uk](mailto:abcd1234@ox.ac.uk)) as your user name/email for that ChatGPT account. You will be given an option to migrate on sign up.

If, on the other hand, you used any other email (for example [first.last@dept.ox.ac.uk](mailto:first.last@dept.ox.ac.uk)) to sign up, you will get a new account under your SSO with ChatGPT Edu and your existing account will remain available in parallel with the new one. If you stop paying for the Plus account, your history will remain available to you. You can also export your data for your records and delete the old account (note, this data cannot be imported in ChatGPT Edu).

Existing ChatGPT Teams accounts cannot merge into the Edu workspace and do not allow data export or access after you stop the subscription. Those accounts would have to close and you would lose your history.

### How would it work?

If you choose to join us in the University of Oxford's ChatGPT Edu workspace, you will be added by OpenAI and receive an email to prompt you to join your new Edu workspace. This will create a new account or ask you to transfer your history. If you were paying for your subscription and your account migrates as part of the sign up, you will automatically receive a pro rata refund.
