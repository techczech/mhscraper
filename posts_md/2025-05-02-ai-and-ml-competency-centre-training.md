The AI and ML Competency Centre offers training that university members can join at any level of expertise, guiding them through a journey to build confidence in understanding the capabilities and limitations of AI systems, and in selecting the most effective tools for tasks in their practice. We do this through workshops that anybody at the University can join and we also offer custom training to departments and colleges aimed at teachers, students and administrators. Our aim is to ensure sustainable learning, enabling participants to become autonomous, self-directed users of the technology who can also share their knowledge with others through, for example, [communities of practice](https://pod.admin.ox.ac.uk/communities-of-practice).

Custom workshops
----------------

We offer **AI training sessions to colleges and departments** during term time, which can be tailored for students to learn how to apply AI practically in their studies, as well as for tutors and support staff who may want to explore the range of available tools. These sessions are best conducted in person and typically last between 1 to 1.5 hours. If you are interested, please give us more details through our [custom training enquiry form](https://forms.office.com/e/gcsBFZgFf5) - due to resource limitation we can only offer these workshops to groups of more than 10 people. We have already delivered similar workshops to St John’s and St Cross Colleges or in departments like the medical school or law.
