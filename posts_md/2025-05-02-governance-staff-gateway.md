The Planning and Council Secretariat website provides a detailed [overview of the University's governance](https://governance.admin.ox.ac.uk/governance).

Council
-------

Council is the University’s principal executive and policy-making body. It is responsible for

* advancing the University’s objectives
* the University’s administration
* managing the University’s finances and property

Council’s function, membership and conduct of business are outlined in the [University’s statutes](https://governance.admin.ox.ac.uk/legislation/statutes).

### Who sits on Council?

Members of Council are the University's charity trustees. There are twenty five positions on Council, plus provision for up to three co-opted members. The Chair of Council is the Vice-Chancellor.

See a list of all [members of Council](https://governance.admin.ox.ac.uk/council/members-council).

### Council's main committees

Council is advised by a range of committees, including five main committees that report directly to Council on core business:

* Education Committee
* General Purposes Committee (GPC)
* Personnel Committee
* Planning and Resource Allocation Committee (PRAC)
* Research Committee

Meetings of Council, agendas and non-confidential minutes and papers are posted on the [Council website](https://governance.admin.ox.ac.uk/council/home).

Congregation
------------

Congregation is the sovereign body of the University and acts as its ‘parliament’. It has over 5,000 members, which include

* academic staff of the University
* heads and other members of governing bodies of colleges
* senior research, computing, library and administrative staff

All resolutions passed by Congregation and all other acts and decisions taken by it are binding to Council.

### Congregation's function

Congregation has responsibility for

* approving changes to the University’s statutes and regulations
* considering major policy issues submitted by Council or members of Congregation
* electing members to Council and other University bodies
* approving the appointment of the Vice-Chancellor

Congregation’s function, membership and procedures are outlined in the [University’s statutes](https://governance.admin.ox.ac.uk/legislation/statute-iv-congregation).

Meetings of Congregation are held on Tuesdays of certain weeks during term time. To check dates of future meetings and read about past proposals and resolutions, visit the [Congregation meetings page](https://governance.admin.ox.ac.uk/congregation#tab-1275026).

Convocation
-----------

Members of Congregation automatically become members of Convocation, a body that also includes former student members of the University who have had a degree conferred by the University (other than an honorary degree), and retired members of Congregation, who were members of Congregation on the date of their retirement. Convocation never meets as a body. Its sole functions are to elect the Chancellor and the Professor of Poetry.

Conference of Colleges
----------------------

The Conference of Colleges is where the colleges come together to deal with matters of shared interest and common purpose.

Conference and its sub-committees have two main functions:

* enable colleges to act collectively on issues that matter to them, which may range from sharing good practice to acting together to procure services
* act as a voice for college interests within the University community and allow colleges to debate and act upon the key issues of the day
