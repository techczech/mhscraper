### How we use local storage

This website makes use of the SaaS tool New Relic to monitor performance. We measure application and server performance to help us optimise the delivery of the site so that we can identify and address problems such as slow loading of pages.

It can be useful to understand patterns of performance, for example how a site performs for a given user as they visit pages on the same site in one session. New Relic creates an identifier – a random string of numbers and letters - to track a user session by temporarily storing the identifier in local storage on your device. This lasts for a maximum of 4 hours or sooner if you end your browser session or become inactive on the site.

Monitoring with New Relic is essential for us to understand any performance issues with this website and assists us to ensure that the site remains usable.
