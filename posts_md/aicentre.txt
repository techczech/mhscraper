ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot Licences
--------------------------------------

### ChatGPT Edu

#### Can I request a ChatGPT licence?

If your department is happy to fund ChatGPT licences, the centre can facilitate your order. At this time, tools purchased through the AI and ML Competency Centre are covered by a data processing agreement with OpenAI to ensure compliance with data protection regulations. To order ChatGPT Edu licences, you will need the agreement of your budget approver, and know how many staff you wish to assign licences. Please [fill out this form](https://unioxfordnexus.sharepoint.com/:l:/s/DGTR-CompetencyCentres/FKmBpPaQ61hGuj1UB0FwY6wB9PzTMfmHhSecfoPfckjJwQ?nav=ZjdiNTlhY2EtYjM3MS00MTUyLThhODUtYjg3YmJiMjlkOTU2) for departments or this [form for colleges](https://unioxfordnexus.sharepoint.com/:l:/s/DGTR-CompetencyCentres/FNzMYoPR4cVGn7hyVdKe78gB7CKdVVSfwJkzP8Kfe1SK5g?nav=ZDBjZDU0NDktMjllNy00ODRiLTlhNTktN2Y4NDFhMTdkNjg2).

Please note that using ChatGPT Free, Plus, or Team versions is possible, but these licences are not supported by the Competency Centre. Licences must be purchased according to your department’s local purchasing rules. Additionally, for data compliance, you must not use these tools with confidential and personal data, since they may not be fully covered under the data processing agreement. Ensure your use aligns with Oxford's information security guidelines by reviewing the following:

#### How long does it take to get my licence after I submit a form?

We are aiming to approve licences on a weekly basis, but we will review this cadence on an ongoing basis.

#### Can I charge my licence cost to a project?

No. There are no plans to allow charging to a project and a GL Cost Centre code will be required.

#### Can students buy a licence directly?

No, only departments can buy licences on behalf of students using their GL Cost Centre code.

#### Can the Competency Centre see my conversations if I purchase a licence through them?

No, we cannot see your conversations - whatever you say to ChatGPT is private unless you choose to share this with others.

#### Can we get a shared account to use, e.g., for a lab, so several people can use it?

ChatGPT Edu does not allow access from shared email accounts, and each individual needs a separate account. It is, however, possible to share conversations with colleagues.

### Microsoft 365 Copilot

#### Can I request a Copilot licence?

For those interested in obtaining a Microsoft 365 Copilot licence, team-level purchases are possible. Please check with your departmental administrator to confirm whether your team can finance this. The cost per licence is £26 per head, and procurement will be managed centrally. To order Copilot licences, you will need the agreement of your budget approver. Please [fill out this form](https://unioxfordnexus.sharepoint.com/:l:/s/DGTR-CompetencyCentres/FEbYTsUBaCdPhUmncfVAQdYBjPPUgdphWgg-KE6t8vKorw?nav=ZGQ3ZGNlOTYtMzRmMC00ODNmLWFlZWUtOWViM2NiY2MxNWIz) for departments or this [form for colleges](https://unioxfordnexus.sharepoint.com/:l:/s/DGTR-CompetencyCentres/FEJJuw60GY1Dg8nhwq5jipABC4e41eNxMsptoa_5TDOUeQ?nav=M2VhZjhlNjItMjk1Yi00YjdkLWFiZmMtM2VlMzI2ODlmOWYw).

#### Where do I access Copilot once I have a licence?

Microsoft 365 Copilot will show up in various places once your licence allocation is active:

Troubleshooting ChatGPT Edu Login Issues
----------------------------------------

#### I'm unable to log into the ChatGPT Edu workspace. What should I do first?

Check OpenAI's Status Page: Visit [OpenAI's status page](https://status.openai.com/) to ensure there isn't a login outage. If there's an outage, you may need to wait until the service is restored.

Confirm Workspace Membership: Make sure you are a member of our enterprise workspace. If you're unsure, check your email for an invitation or reach out to [our team](mailto:%20aimlcompetencycentre@it.ox.ac.uk).

#### I can no longer access my ChatGPT Edu account. What should I do?

Due to a change in the OpenAI configuration, all ChatGPT Edu users who have their accounts associated with an department email rather than SSO will now have to login with their email as username and password. If you think this applies to you, please follow the steps outlined in our [Troubleshooting ChatGPT Edu Login Issues](https://staff.admin.ox.ac.uk/troubleshooting-chatgpt-edu-login-problems) page.

### For SBS (Said Business School) Users:

#### How should I log in to the ChatGPT Edu workspace?

Use your departmental email address and password. SBS users cannot use Single Sign-On (SSO) to access the workspace.

#### I forgot my password or previously tried logging in with SSO. What should I do?

Reset Password: Click the "Forgot Password" link on the login page to reset your password.

#### I originally created my ChatGPT account using SSO but I'm an SBS user. How can I switch to password authentication?

Contact OpenAI Support: Reach out to OpenAI directly via the OpenAI Help Center and request to switch your authentication method from SSO to password. If they object, mention that the enterprise workspace is on a different ID provider, so you have to login via password.

### For Non-SBS Users:

#### How should I log in to the ChatGPT Edu workspace?

Use Single Sign-On (SSO): You must log in using SSO. Enter your email address (departmental address), and you should be given an option to log in via SSO. Follow the SSO login instructions after that.

#### I can't log in

a. Ensure your departmental email is correctly mapped to your UPN. Misalignment can cause login issues. You may need to reach out to your IT department to confirm or update this mapping.

b. Correct Email Address: Ensure you're using the correct email address to log in. If you were invited using your User Principal Name (UPN) address, you must use that, not your departmental email address.

c. Switch to UPN address: If you originally joined the enterprise workspace using your department address, but when trying to login via SSO, get an error message saying that you cannot access any workspaces, you may need to be reinvited to the enterprise workspace over your UPN address. Contact the [AI and ML Competency Centre](mailto:%20aimlcompetencycentre@it.ox.ac.uk) to request this switch. **Note:** This will create a new account, and you may lose personal settings and chat history, if you have concerns about that, please raise them in your email, and we will try to find another way.

#### Issues with platform.openai.com:

#### I can't log in or access my projects on platform.openai.com. What should I do?

Contact Administrator: Ask your [administrator](mailto:%20aimlcompetencycentre@it.ox.ac.uk) to remove and re-add you to the organisation's account and your respective projects using your UPN.

#### I've tried all the steps but still can't log in. What should I do next?

[Contact OpenAI Support](https://help.openai.com/en/)

How do I get started with AI Coding Assistants like GitHub Copilot?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

AI coding assistants have rapidly transformed the landscape of software development, making it easier for developers to design, write, and debug code. Here’s a quick introduction to these tools, their capabilities, limitations, data privacy considerations, and how to access them.

#### Overview of Tools

Large Language Models (LLMs) do not only understand language but also code and can help with a multitude of coding tasks. AI coding assistants, powered by LLMs, can be integrated into development environments to assist with tasks like:

* **Code completion**: Predicting the next line of code or entire functions.
* **Bug detection and fixes**: Highlighting issues and suggesting improvements.
* **Documentation**: Generating comments and explaining code snippets.
* **Testing**: Creating unit tests or validating logic.

Popular tools include:

#### What Coding Assistants Can and Can’t Do

AI coding assistants can significantly improve productivity, but their utility depends on how you use them:

##### What they can do:

* Save time by automating repetitive tasks.
* Offer suggestions to improve code readability and quality.
* Provide support for learning new programming languages or frameworks.
* Assist with brainstorming approaches to complex problems.

##### What they can’t do:

* Guarantee error-free code: AI-generated code may introduce bugs.
* Replace domain expertise: You’ll need to validate outputs. AI tools can write queries that mess up entire databases.
* Fully automate software development: While they can generate entire features, oversight is critical.

#### Access GitHub Copilot for Free

As a member of a university, you may be eligible for free access to **GitHub Copilot Individual** under the [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/) Program. To apply you will first need a create a GitHub account which you can do at [Join GitHub](https://github.com/signup). Once you have a GitHub Account here is how to apply to access GitHub Copilot Individual:

1. Add your university email to your GitHub account under [email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails) if you did not already use your university email to create your GitHub Account.
2. [Apply to GitHub Education as a teacher](https://docs.github.com/en/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/github-education-for-teachers/apply-to-github-education-as-a-teacher), explaining how it will support education or learning at the University.
3. Once approved, follow the steps [Getting free access to Copilot as a student, teacher, or maintainer](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/managing-your-copilot-subscription/getting-free-access-to-copilot-as-a-student-teacher-or-maintainer).

Using GitHub Copilot involves sharing snippets of your code with the GitHub directly, whether or not your already host your code on GitHub, which may raise privacy concerns. Here are key data privacy considerations for GitHub Copilot that you should take into account before deciding to use GitHub Copilot with your codebase:

* **Data used for training GitHub models**: The GitHub Copilot Individual Plan that is available for free through GitHub Education is covered by the [GitHub Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement). It is important to note that GitHub do not explicitly state that user data (code, prompts, snippets) is excluded from training GitHub models. Only the GitHub Copilot Business and Enterprise plans explicitly state that user data is not used to train GitHub models. Please see the [GitHub Copilot Trust Center details](https://copilot.github.trust.page/).
* **Data retained by GitHub for further processing and sharing**: Individual users can disable code snippet retention in their GitHub settings under [Allow GitHub to use my code snippets for product improvements](https://github.com/settings/copilot). The [Managing Copilot policies as an individual subscriber](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/managing-copilot-policies-as-an-individual-subscriber#enabling-or-disabling-prompt-and-suggestion-collection) page provides additional details that confirms this setting controls retention of both prompts and code suggestions. Please note that GitHub have not made any official statement to confirm if disabling this setting is equivalent to the GitHub Copilot Business and Enterprise statement that user data is not used for training GitHub models.

-------------------------

The University is currently actively supporting these two tools. They are available for purchase through IT Services: [Buying Generative AI licence](https://staff.admin.ox.ac.uk/buying-generative-ai-licences)s.

#### ChatGPT Edu

ChatGPT is the best known generative AI application. Its launch in November 2022 sparked the current generative AI revolution and it is arguably the best place to start learning about what generative AI can do. It has some of the most advanced models and most comprehensive features and there are five tiers available to users: free, Plus, Team, Edu and Enterprise – each of these slightly differs regarding the features available, the amount you can use them, and the confidentiality of the data you input.

We are currently running a Pilot with 250 people of ChatGPT Edu and we are exploring ways of expanding access to more people. If you are interested in purchasing a ChatGPT Edu licence, you can [find out more information on our webpage.](https://staff.admin.ox.ac.uk/buying-generative-ai-licences)

#### Microsoft 365 Copilot

Microsoft 365 Copilot is distinct from [Copilot Chat](#Microsoft%20Copilot%20Chat). It is an integration of generative AI models into Exchange, Teams and Microsoft Office. It offers features such as summarising email conversations, creating PowerPoint presentations out of documents, creating meeting minutes, etc. If you are wanting to use Copilot to record or transcribe meetings, you must first request access to do so: [Record a meeting in Teams | IT Help](https://help.it.ox.ac.uk/record-a-meeting-in-teams)

We are currently supporting a pilot programme with 500 users across the University. Microsoft 365 Copilot is also available for departments at the estimated cost of £26/per person/per month. You can find out more about [purchasing Copilot for Microsoft 365 licences on our webpage](https://staff.admin.ox.ac.uk/buying-generative-ai-licences).

#### Microsoft Copilot Chat

Microsoft Copilot (Chat) is a limited alternative to ChatGPT offered for free by Microsoft. When users login to Copilot with their Oxford University SSO, they will be offered additional enterprise protections.

Note: Free Copilot Chat does not offer integration with Microsoft Office.

Note on data

*Both ChatGPT and Copilot, when purchased through the Centre, are suitable for all confidential and personally identifiable information. We have an agreement with both OpenAI and Microsoft to not use the University data for training, finetuning or evaluating their models.*

Tools we are exploring
----------------------

We are currently exploring a number of generative AI tools for research, teaching and administration.

If you are currently paying for ChatGPT Plus or Teams individually, we strongly recommend you consider switching to ChatGPT Edu. Transitioning to the Edu licence will provide better value, stronger privacy protections, and access to features designed specifically for academic environments. The University-managed licence also ensures compliance with institutional data policies.

By using ChatGPT Edu instead of free or individually purchased versions, University of Oxford **staff can confidently use ChatGPT for their academic and administrative work** while maintaining appropriate data protection standards.

### Reasons to switch to ChatGPT Edu:

* **Saving money.** We are offering a ChatGPT Edu licence at a reduced rate. It is cheaper than a Plus or Teams licence.
* **Better security.** You can **access ChatGPT Edu via your SSO,** which gives you more security and convenience than either the Plus or Teams licence.
* **Share your GPTs and chats** privately with others in the Oxford workspace or with the whole Oxford workspace all at once.
* **Enhanced data protection:** Unlike the free and Plus versions (where you have to manually opt out of allowing your data to be used to train OpenAI’s data models), data you input into ChatGPT Edu is not shared to train OpenAI's models by default. This means you maintain full ownership of all your inputs and outputs, which is important when working with research data or sensitive university information.
* **Security assessment.** Only ChatGPT Edu is covered by InfoSec’s third-party security assessment (TPSA). This is the same security assessment that covers all use of Microsoft 365 across the University. If you feel secure uploading files to Sharepoint, you should feel at ease uploading your files to ChatGPT Edu.

### Things to bear in mind:

* There is **no export option** of your data if you are using in ChatGPT Edu (this is also the case for the Teams licence, but Plus or Free accounts however do allow data export).
* Occasionally, **some new features and models are released on a delay** to ChatGPT Edu to allow for review or compliance. This is usually about a week or so later but occasionally longer.

### Migrating your existing data:

You can only automatically merge your chat history from a Free or Plus account if you used your SSO ([abcd1234@ox.ac.uk](mailto:abcd1234@ox.ac.uk)) as your user name/email for that ChatGPT account. You will be given an option to migrate on sign up.

If, on the other hand, you used any other email (for example [first.last@dept.ox.ac.uk](mailto:first.last@dept.ox.ac.uk)) to sign up, you will get a new account under your SSO with ChatGPT Edu and your existing account will remain available in parallel with the new one. If you stop paying for the Plus account, your history will remain available to you. You can also export your data for your records and delete the old account (note, this data cannot be imported in ChatGPT Edu).

Existing ChatGPT Teams accounts cannot merge into the Edu workspace and do not allow data export or access after you stop the subscription. Those accounts would have to close and you would lose your history.

### How would it work?

If you choose to join us in the University of Oxford's ChatGPT Edu workspace, you will be added by OpenAI and receive an email to prompt you to join your new Edu workspace. This will create a new account or ask you to transfer your history. If you were paying for your subscription and your account migrates as part of the sign up, you will automatically receive a pro rata refund.

### How do I switch?

If you would like to join us in ChatGPT Edu, you simply need to fill in the relevant form (linked above) to initiate the process.

The [AI and Machine Learning Competency Centre](https://staff.admin.ox.ac.uk/digital/services/competency-centres/ai-and-ml) has been conducting [customised workshops](https://staff.admin.ox.ac.uk/ai-and-ml-competency-centre-training#/Custom%20workshops) in colleges and departments to help staff and students access and apply AI tools in their work and studies. As AI becomes more prevalent, it is necessary to ensure that all members of the University can explore the use of these tools safely and ethically in accordance with guidelines.

Lead Business Technologist Kelly Webb-Davies has been leading some of these workshops. One such example from Michaelmas term ’24 was the half-day Student AI Skills Induction workshop. Module leads from the Medical Sciences Division (MSD) organised this workshop for incoming master’s students to provide a general introduction to generative AI and its capabilities. The aim was to equip these students with a better understanding of AI as they enter their degrees and learn how to approach these tools effectively and responsibly.

In her session, Kelly explained how to use generative AI responsibly, reminding students to use these tools cautiously and demonstrating their limitations as search engines or referencing tools. She used the analogy of identifying AI as ‘the stranger you spoke to at the pub’ to emphasise the need to fact-check answers given by AI and take everything it provides with a pinch of salt.

The lecture wasn’t all doom and gloom though. Kelly also described AI as ‘The Intern’, ‘The Translator’, and ‘The Tutor’ to show how tools like ChatGPT can be used to check grammar, provide suggestions and perspectives, alter writing style, and even help to create quizzes or explain complex concepts. Kelly’s session was well received by students who said:

> The information was very well targeted to the audience. It taught me instances that I can use AI and others that I should stay away from engaging with this tech.

> I liked the clarity about how we can actually use AI for academic writing. It is helpful to have it acknowledged as a tool rather than not discussed, since it is such a prevalent system.

This is just one example of the sessions run by the AI and ML Competency Centre. The team can also offer sessions introducing different AI tools and how best to apply these for more productive study, addressing strengths and limitations of each. Providing students with the platform to ask questions about AI and learn about how to apply tools responsibly in their studies is critical to unlocking the future of digital education. If you think members of your college or department could benefit from AI training, [contact the AI and ML Competency Centre](mailto:aimlsupportcentre@it.ox.ac.uk) to discuss your needs.
